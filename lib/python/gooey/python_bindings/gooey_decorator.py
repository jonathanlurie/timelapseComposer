Hey, whaduya know. This is out of date again. TODO: update giant doctring.


##How things work these days (though, likely to change)

The decorator is used solely as a nice way to get the location
of the executing script. It no longer returns a decorated version
of the client code, but in fact completely hijacks the execution.
So, rather than returning a reference to the client's main, it now
returns itself, thus short-circuiting the execution of the client
program.

What it DOES do now is grab where the client module is stored and
read it in as a file so that it can hack away at it.

The first step, as before, is getting the ArgumentParser reference
so that the needed values can be extracted. This is done by reading
the source file up to the point where the `parse_args()` method is
called. This puts us smack in the middle of the client's `main` method.

This first half guarantees that all imports, modules, variable assignments,
etc.. are caught (unlike before).

Next step: getting the rest of the source code that's relevant

The file is again read up to the `parse_args` call, but this time everything
leading up to that point is dropped and we keep only the remainder of the file.
So, now the top and the bottom is located, but the bottom needs to be trimmed a
little more -- we want to drop everything remaining in the main method.

So, we `dropwhile` lines are currently indented (and thus still part of the `main`
method)

Finally, we arrive at the end, which gives us an exact copy of the original source
file, minus all of it's main logic. The two pieces are then sandwiched together,
saved to a file, and imported as a new module. Now all that has to be done is call
it (moddified) main function, and bam! It returns to fully populated parser object
to us. No more complicated ast stuff. Just a little bit of string parsing and we're
done.
